I am a Junior at New York University, majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. I am interested in the intersection of computer systems and data-intensive infrastructures, particularly in the context of distributed systems and cloud computing. 

You can call me Jamal, 曹政(My Chinese Name), or Sloth(树懒).
